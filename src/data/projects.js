We sponsor talented students in Nepal, especially those from grades 6 to 10 who are either academically gifted or skilled in sports but financially challenged.\n\nOur goal is to keep them in school during the years they are most likely to drop out, and to build a self-sustaining system where today's students become tomorrow's donors. So it is not just about sponsorship, it is about creating a long-term cycle of opportunity.", raised: 1750, goal: 3500, completed: false },

Project Evaluation is our way of seeing beyond test scores—recognizing creativity, curiosity, and potential.\n\nThrough our mentor–mentee program, we connect with students weekly to guide, listen, and support their growth.\n\nBecause real education is not about exams—it is about discovering talent, nurturing dreams, and walking beside every student’s journey.", raised: 1200, goal: 3000, completed: false },

Project Nepal is our long-term mission to build an education model that is truly home-grown.\n\nChange should not rely on one person’s vision but on research, understanding, and collaboration. Through research grants for master’s and PhD students, we are uncovering ideas that reflect Nepal’s strengths—its culture, its people, and its land.\n\nBecause real revolutions in education do not come from outside; they rise from within Nepal itself.", raised: 0, goal: 10000, completed: false },
