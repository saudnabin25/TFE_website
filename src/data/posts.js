      "In 1853, 220 years of isolation policy of Tokugawa Shogunate trembled to the core, and Japan was forced to open its country. An incident remembered in Japanese History as the ‘Arrival of the Black Ships’. The nation was threatened with signing humiliating treaties by the gunboats of Commodore Perry docked in Tokyo Harbor.",
      "Almost 50 years ago, in 1816 Nepal signed an even more humiliating treaty with the East India Company to put an end to the Anglo-Nepal War. The treaty involved Nepal giving up almost 2/3 of her land and permanent presence of a British resident in Kathmandu.",

      "These two Asian countries separated by hundreds of miles found themselves in a similar position which most of the world found itself in the 19th Century. The industrialized west had come knocking on their doors looking for markets and trade routes to sell their products and to colonize their lands if need be.",
      "A culture of warriors was present in both countries, ‘Gurkhas’ in Nepal and ‘Samurais’ in Japan. Honor of these countries was dealt a death blow by these treaties. An honor that was to be restored and respect that had to be earned in front of a highly militarized opponent.",
      "Both countries had realized that modern education would be crucial to compete with the Western countries and the elite of both countries were dazzled by the material progress of the West."

          "The purpose of the new education is to develop within each student the ability to advance in life.",
          "To achieve this, the new curriculum must avoid the feudal teachings of the past that proved meaningless, to be replaced with new courses that will enable the individual to advance in life with the technological knowledge according to the chosen field of endeavor.",
          "In contrast to the old schools, each serving a particular social class, all students should attend school regardless of social background so that no family has an uneducated member.",
          "Since the local community will primarily benefit from the school, it must be financed by the local community."
        ]
      },
      "Meanwhile, Nepal started modernizing education almost twenty years before Japan. Jung Bahadur Rana, impressed by the innovations and progress of Britain, decided to establish Durbar High School in 1854. Durbar High School was the introduction of modern education in Nepal.",
      "The aftermath of Both Approaches",
      "In Nepal, By the turn of the century in 1901, Dev Shumsher became the first Prime Minister to allow students from families other than the Rana Family to study at Durbar High School. He was the first to propose a National Education Policy ironically inspired by the reformations in Japan.\n\nDev Shumsher was prime minister of Nepal for 114 days, his government was overtaken by a coup d’état by his own brother, and all his policy changes were reversed. Nepal had to wait a century from the establishment of Durbar High School in 1951 to get a universal education policy.",
      "By 1901, Education Policy in Japan had gone through four revisions where a system of Western Science and Eastern Morality was implemented. The enrollment in elementary education was 90% in Japan for school-age children. Japan was well on its way to becoming one of the strongest powers in the world. Teeming with newly established railways, and the wave of industrialization.",
      "By 1894-95, Japan had renegotiated all the unequal treaties with the Western countries on the back of their industrializing economy and military power.\n\nBy 1904, Japan became the first Asian country in modern history to defeat a major European power by defeating the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War. Japan had restored her honor and gained unprecedented respect.",
      "Conclusion",
      "Literacy rate of Japan today is 99%, virtually 100%. It is the third biggest economy in the world and admired around the world for its achievements in science and technology. The success of Japan in so small part was built by a universal policy of education which was built to compete at the world stage.",
      "Our case is not that Nepal would have achieved similar success in quantity as Japan as in the last 150 years if the education policy had been in place. But Nepal would have surely been better off than what it is today.",
      "History rewards nations which learn and plan well for the future.",

      "Restricted Understanding of Education In Our Subconscious",
      "There is a heightened emphasis on formal education in Nepal to climb the socio-economic ladder and be a respected member of the society. It is apparent to anyone who has grown up in Nepal that the insistence on and desire of getting a government job is a phenomenon that fascinates you.",
      "We have formed cliches around professions like Doctors, Engineers and the ones who fail at these and end up pursuing other professions. The outright craze which one witnesses in and around preparation centers of IOE and IOM exams is a sight to behold for anyone who has a passing interest in studying societies.",
      "Technical Education in the context of Nepal:",
      "While Professions which do not require lakhs of investment upfront can earn a decent amount with 2-3 years of experience are disregarded as professions not worth getting into. Professions a 17–18- year-old after finishing high school can pursue with limited investment and can start earning within 15-24 months can be reasonable alternatives.",
      "How is Technical Education defined?",
      "Careers and education focused on the training in application of a specific science/technology fall under the milieu of technical education.
