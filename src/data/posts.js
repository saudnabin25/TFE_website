      "In 1853, 220 years of isolation policy of the Tokugawa Shogunate trembled to the core, and Japan was forced to open its country—an incident remembered in Japanese history as the “Arrival of the Black Ships.” The nation was threatened with signing humiliating treaties by the gunboats of Commodore Perry docked in Tokyo Harbor.",
      "Almost 50 years earlier, in 1816, Nepal signed an even more humiliating treaty with the East India Company to put an end to the Anglo-Nepal War. The treaty involved Nepal giving up almost two-thirds of her land and accepting the permanent presence of a British resident in Kathmandu.",
      "These two Asian countries, separated by hundreds of miles, found themselves in a similar position to much of the world in the nineteenth century. The industrialized West came knocking on their doors, searching for markets and trade routes to sell their products—and to colonize their lands if need be.",
      "A culture of warriors thrived in both countries—“Gurkhas” in Nepal and “Samurais” in Japan. The honor of these nations was dealt a devastating blow by the treaties. Restoring that honor, and earning respect in front of a highly militarized opponent, became a national mission.",
      "Both countries realized that modern education would be crucial to competing with Western powers. The elites of Nepal and Japan alike were dazzled by the material progress of the West, and they understood that schools, teachers, and new ideas were the foundations for reclaiming their futures."
