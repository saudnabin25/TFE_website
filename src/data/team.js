    about: "Hi there, I’m Nabin Saud — born and raised in Nepal, and I moved to the United States at the age of 15. I studied until 9th grade in Nepal and continued my high school in Herndon, Virginia. My passion for technology inspired me to study Computer Science — a foundation that continues to shape everything I do today.\n\n\nI’ve always loved the idea of learning — discovering new things and growing every day. But as I got older, school stopped feeling as exciting, and I couldn’t help but wonder what went wrong. That question led me and Aasutosh to start Trinket for Education (TFE), a nonprofit dedicated to making learning fun and meaningful again. Check out our projects to see how we’re turning that vision into reality.\n\n\nWe also believe education is a basic right, so with the help of our donors, we sponsor bright students who face financial challenges, ensuring no child is held back by their circumstances.",
