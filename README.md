# Nonprofit React (Vite + Tailwind)

A lightweight React site matching your screenshots: Projects grid (with progress bars), Team section with filter chips, Blog/Latest Posts band, and a Team Member detail page.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL.

## Structure
- `src/components/ProjectsSection.jsx` – "Projects That Need Your Support"
- `src/components/TeamSection.jsx` – "Meet Our Team" + filter chips
- `src/components/BlogSection.jsx` – "Latest Posts" dark band
- `src/pages/TeamMember.jsx` – profile detail page
- `src/data/*.js` – content you can edit without touching components
